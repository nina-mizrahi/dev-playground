# Dev-Playground  
by Nina Mizrahi  

## Overview  
This repository is a sandbox of development exercises, mini-projects and code experiments showcasing my breadth in software engineering, algorithmic thinking, and exploratory programming! It’s where I test ideas, sharpen skills and build utilities that don’t always fit into a major project but still reflect technical growth.
